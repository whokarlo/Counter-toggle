this is meant to be practice.

this is a counter application with a toggle feature for light and dark mode allowed.

this counter will have the count and how many clicks were counted.
underneath will have the buttons for increment / decrement / reset.

this is practice for a lot of purposes.

- this is allowing you to learn basic react syntax like useState, using Props.
- this is allowing you to learn how to use tailwind with pieces of it.
- this also helping you understand the usefulness of TS and allowing you to solve issue earlier than later.
