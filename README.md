# Counter-toggle
mini project for learning react, using github, learning typescript and learning tailwind all at the same time.

this project is soley to learn how to use react and getting use to useState, Props.
this is also for learning to use tailwind and understanding its syntax. 
- i thought i would be harder but already knowing css makes it 10x smoother.

- this will have a increment / decrement / reset button.
- the top div will have the count and the # of times clicked.

- lastly, top right corner i will be working on putting two buttons for toggling light and dark mode.
